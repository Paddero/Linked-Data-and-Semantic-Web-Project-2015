# Galway Tourist Information
** by Patryk Piecha **

This project will give users (Toursists as well as families living in County Galway) information about playgrounds and beach lifeguard service locations in County Galway.

## Datasets used
The datasets that I am going to use are:

  - Playgrounds County Galway - http://data.galwaycoco.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d5d7885b049d489fa9b8e5339488c1df_0.csv
  - Beach Lifeguard Service Locations - http://data.galwaycoco.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c2d83f3c2c014347b06caf98031eddb3_0.csv

Both of these datasets are from data.gov.ie

## How to Use the API in command prompt
In command prompt run the app.js file. The things you will need to have installed are:

- express
- body-parser
- fs
- sqlite3

When you run the app, it will show the menu as shown below:

Use the on screen menu and follow instruction in order to Add a Playground or a Beach in command prompt, as well as to check which areas contain Playgrounds and Beaches.
